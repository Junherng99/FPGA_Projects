# FPGA_Projects

Hello! I will be uploading some simple FPGA projects done by myself involving the basys-3 board. I will be sharing some projects (small or large) here and possibly some explainations that might help some learners progress better.

Some details for the projects done here: <br> 
1) Coding done using Xillinx Vivado version 2018.2 
2) Projects are for the Artix-7 based Basys-3 Board
